# Dot32 Intro
The intro i place into most of my love2D projects;
May or may not be exactly what is in every project of mine as older projects go out of date, and i may tweak a version of the intro to better fit that particular project's needs.

The intro also comes with some useful functions that i use frequently, such as being able to convert any table into a string for printing (good for debug) or for HSL to RBG colour conversion!
